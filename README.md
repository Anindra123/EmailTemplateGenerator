# EmailTemplateGenerator
This application will create an Email Template Generator. 
It will create a template of an email for a regular event.

The application will ask for the following inputs: 
1) Name of the Event
2) Date of the Event
3) Time of the Event 

The Email template will be generated in TXT format. 

# Roadmap
1. Create a menu item
2. Create input features.
3. Create the generated email template and save it as a text file.

# Language / Form 
Console Application built in C#. 

Future plans: Windows Form for better GUI.

# Additional Notes:
I also created this project to assist me to having better understanding of the .Net Framework.
